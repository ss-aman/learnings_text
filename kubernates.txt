pod - an abstraction over a container, running environment or layer
		one container inside one contaier, runs multiple container only if other containers are dependent over it
		gives virtual network, each pod gets its ip address, 
		container crash and die -> pod crash -> new pod -> new ip -> solution is "service"

service -> service and pod life cycle aren't connected
		external and internal service
		service-ip:port

		url should be a name -> solution -> ingress


ingress -> first request to ingress then forward to service
