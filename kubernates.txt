	what is it
	k8s architecture
	k8s main components
	mini kube and kubectl
	main kubectl command 
	k8s YAML config file

	k8s namespaces
	k8s ingress
	helm package manager

	volumes - persisting data in k8s
	k8s statefulset - deploying stateful apps
	k8s services


-> what is it
k8s open source container orchestration framework
container manage in physical or virtual or cloud  or in hybrid 

- > what problem k8s solve
high availability no downtime
scalability or high performance
disaster recovery backup and restore


-> k8s components
 devops and software devp
pod - an abstraction over a container, running environment or layer
		one container inside one contaier, runs multiple container only if other containers are dependent over it
		gives virtual network, each pod gets its ip address, 
		container crash and die -> pod crash -> new pod -> new ip -> solution is "service"

service -> service and pod life cycle aren't connected
		external and internal service
		service-ip:port

		url should be a name -> solution -> ingress


ingress -> first request to ingress then forward to service


# url where configure -> properties file, environment var, inside the built image of server.

# pull image -> restart. rebuild->push to repo->pull it in your repo 


external configurations -> using configmap and secrets

-> configmap -> external configuration to application
			pods gets data which config map contains

-> secret -> base 64 encoded, secret config data

@Data Storage

-> Volume for persisted data storage
	just maps the specific physical hardware storage mapped with pod, own premisis storage.
	but we have to set all things, backing up, replicating, sync

	or on remote 
	k8s cluster, all components and sotrage
	we are replicating things on multiple servers

@ we have to create replicas
	- Database replicas stateful


@ stateful set -> instead of replicating try StateFul

@Replicating mechanism -> Deployment and StatefulSet


---
@architecture 

-> StateFul

-> Service -> static ip address
				load balancer
